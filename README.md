# FeCrAs-Model-CPP

This is the C++ version of the code for my PhD thesis. The purpose of writing this repository is to provide some transparency for my PhD thesis and enable extensions to the code. One goal for the code is to make the code clearer. Another is to make the code faster by writing it entirely in proper C++.
